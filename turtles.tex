\begin{abstract}
  Proper dynamic program analysis requires solid collection of call frequency,
  relationships, and timing. Typically, this is achieved with a suite of
  language-centric tools, e.g., valgrind (C/C++), the GHC profiling subsystem
  (Haskell). Tcl appears to lack similar tools or at least requires significant
  language extensions to meet this need. Consequently, this work introduces
  the Tcl Universal Recursive Trace Log Execution Scrutinizer (TURTLES), a
  simple proc tracing interface that yields easily aggregated and analyzed
  call records. By adhering to pure Tcl, the endeavor provides an enlightening
  Ã©tude in the pain points of developing such tooling in the language.
